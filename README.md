# Portfolio Prep

Welcome to my portfolio preparation repository! In this repository, I have gathered all the information and assets I need to build my personal portfolio site. Here's a quick rundown of what's included:

## Description of Myself

- Catchy title: From analyst to software developer
- Personal headline: Game Developer Specializing in Creating Websites for classic games as well as 2d games
- Professional pitch: As a seasoned intelligence analyst with 5 deployments and over 15 years of experience in the field, I bring a unique perspective and set of skills to the world of game development. With an eye for detail and a passion for RPGs, I am dedicated to creating immersive and engaging gaming experiences that capture the imagination of players. My extensive experience in analyzing complex data sets and identifying patterns and trends allows me to bring a strategic and analytical approach to game development, ensuring that each game is carefully crafted to meet the needs and desires of its target audience. Whether working on a small indie project or a large-scale AAA title, I am committed to bringing my expertise and passion to every aspect of game development, from concept to release.
- What excites me about tech: As someone passionate about bringing games to life and with a love for RPGs, the ever-evolving technology presents exciting opportunities to develop immersive and engaging gaming experiences. While the intelligence field is intellectually stimulating, game development provides greater creative freedom and hands-on involvement in new projects, with the added benefit of utilizing analytical and strategic planning skills.
